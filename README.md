## Design Description
Frog legs v1: A holonomic drivetrain to provide quick and agile movement. Bumpers around the drivetrain to protect the wheels. The brain is centrally located to lower the center of mass. The grabber can pitch and yaw freely with treads/wheels able to shoot the tri-balls TBD how we will get the robot off the ground for the end of the competition 

# First prototype
Our first prototype had a basic, functioning holonomic drive.\
We are still missing
- A battery mount
- A place for the brain
- Any semblance of cable management
- The grabber mechanism
